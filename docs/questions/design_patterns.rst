Design Patterns
================

#. How is elasticity different from scalability?
#. Describe CAP theorem for distributed systems.
#. Explain what cohesion means in software architecture.
#. Explain the difference between starvation, deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them.
#. What is eventual consistency? Why is it important?
#. Explain ACID principles.
#. What is domain driven design?
#. Explain what sticky load balancing is and when to use it.
#. How to reduce or control throughput of microservice? What to keep in mind?
#. What is bounded context in microservice architecture?
#. Suppose you are moving a monolithic application to microservice in a 1-year time frame. Now you have developed 2 modules in 3 months and let's assume 8 other modules are pending. In this scenario how will you maintain the application? (various practical examples)
#. What is the difference between Orchestration vs Choreography?
#. What are the REST principles you are following in your project?
#. Suppose you have developed a microservice API which has hit count 2000/s and every time this API uses a third-party API for data retrieval. Now your license for the third-party API permits hits 1000/s. How will you handle this scenario in terms of latency?
#. Explain high availability in the software architecture field.
#. What is clustering, and why do you need it?
#. Given a monolith application, you are asked to redesign it to microservice architecture. Explain the factors you will consider during design.
#. Explain twelve factor app principles.
#. What is ELK stack, and how to fit it into your design?
