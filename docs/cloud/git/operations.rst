Git Operations
==============


Git Repo -> Staging Area + Commit Folder

Git Configurations

.. code-block:: bash

    git config --global user.name "revanna7226"

    git config user.name

    git config --global user.email "revanna@email.com"

    git config --list

    git remote add <repo_name>/origin <repo_url>




Turn a directory into git repository or make directory managed by git.

.. code-block:: bash

    git init

To explore our commit history with git log. To exit this menu, please press "q" and confirm this with Enter on your keyboard.

.. code-block:: bash

    git log
    git log --one-line

To Switch to specific commit

.. code-block:: bash

    # shows the commit history
    git log

    # take a commit id from the logs and use in the below command.
    git checkout <commit_id>

    # to switch back to branch
    git checkout master

Deleting working directory files

.. code-block:: bash

    # this command deletes the file and stages for commit.
    # this equal to (manual delete + git add )
    git rm <files/folder>

Undoing or revert unstaged changes

.. code-block:: bash

    # to undo perticular file
    git checkout <file>
    # recommanded
    git restore <file>

    # to undo all changes which are unstaged
    git checkout .
    # recommanded
    git restore .

Delete untracked files

.. code-block:: bash

    # this lists all files which are untracked and picked up for delete
    # flags: d delete, n list
    git clean -dn

    # this deletes all untracked files
    # flags: d delete, f force
    git clean -df

Undoing or reverting staged changes

.. code-block:: bash

    # unstage single or all files
    git reset <file>
    git reset .

    # revert a file or all files
    git restore <file>
    git restore .

Deleting or undo commits with git reset

.. code-block:: bash

    # delete last one commit and stay changes in staged area
    git reset --soft HEAD~1

    # delete last commit and remove all files permanently
    git reset --hard HEAD~1


Commmands to see which are files are tracking by git

.. code-block:: bash

    git ls-files

Deleting a branch

.. code-block:: bash

    # only if it has already been fully merged into its upstream branch
    git branch -d <branch>

    # force deletes the branch, regardless of its merge status
    git branch -D <branch-name> [<branch-name>]


Committing detached HEAD changes

.. code-block:: bash

    git log
    # checkout to any commit
    git checkout <commit-hash>

    # do some changes
    git add .
    git commit -m 'commit message'

    # you are in detached head
    git branch 
    # create a new branch for detached head
    git branch detached-head

    git switch master

    git merge detached-head

    git branch -D detached-head


bringing lost data back with *git reflog*

A log of all project changes made including deleted commits

.. code-block:: bash

    # deletes last commit changes and files
    git reset --hard HEAD~1

    # shows the activity of git operations done in the repo
    git reflog

    # use hex id of the last commit in the reflog activity list
    git reset --hard <hash-code>

    # --- delete branch and restore
    # create a branch, do some changes and commit all the changes.
    # delete the branch  
    git branch -D <branch-name>

    # get activity list
    git reflog

    # checkout to last commit of the branch, you will be in the detached HEAD
    git checkout <hash-code>

    # create new branch for detached head changes
    git switch -c <branch>





1. `git status` is used to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed

.. code-block:: bash

    git status


2. `git add <file-name>` to update what will be committed or staged

.. code-block:: bash

    # stage a single file, or multile files by separating file names by comma
    git add <file-name>
    git add <file1>,<file2>

    # stage all changes at once shot
    git add *

Unstage staged files

.. code-block:: bash

    # unstage single file
    git restore --staged <file>

    # unstage all files
    git restore --staged .


3. `git commit -m "write commit message"` is used to commit changes

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -m "write commit message"


4. `git push origin main` is used to push the project to GitHub main branch

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin main


5. `git branch` shows branches present in this repository and also we can see which is the active branch indicated by asterisk.

.. code-block:: bash

    # lists local branches
    git branch

    # lists local branches and remote tracking branches
    git branch -a

    # lists remote branches available
    git ls-remote

    # git create local-tracking branch and


6. `git clone <url> <new-folder-name>` used to clone the project

.. code-block:: bash

    # clone master branch to local
    git clone <url> <new-folder-name>

    # clone a perticular branch to local
    git clone -b <branch> <repo-url> <new-folder-name>


7. `git branch <new-branch-name>` used to create new branch

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch <new-branch-name>


8. `git checkout <branch-name>` used to switch from one branch to another branch

.. code-block:: bash

    # switch to existing branch
    git checkout <branch-name>

    # Aletrnative
    git switch <branch-name>

    # create new branch and switch to it
    git checkout -b <branch-name>

    # Aletrnative
    git switch -c <branch-name>
    

9.  `git diff` compare the changes

.. code-block:: bash

    git diff

10.  Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory.
     https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash

     Temporary storage for unstaged and uncommitted changes

.. code-block:: bash

    # push the intermediate changes with index reference
    git stash

    # push the intermediate changes with a message
    git stash push -m "message to temp save"

    # to check for all the stashes
    git stash list

    # to load a perticular changes use index to load
    git stash apply <stash-index>

    # to load a perticular changes with index and drop the stash
    git stash pop <stash-index>

    # to remove a stash with an index
    git stash drop <stash-index>

    # need to check what is it
    git stash clear


Understanding Merge Types
-------------------------

Combining commits from different branches by creating a new merge commit
(recursive) or by moving the HEAD (fast-forward)

There are two types of merge mainly we use in our day to day activities.

1. Fast-Forward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only possible when there are no commits in the master after feature branch was created.

*Merge* moves HEAD forward but does not create new commit.

.. image:: /_static/images/ff-merge.png

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch
    # master
    # feature

    # switch to master branch and run merge command
    git merge feature

    # no commits required

If you don't want to have intermediate commits which is done in the feature branch do SQUASH commit.

Explicite commit is required here for merge action.

.. code-block:: bash

    # squashes all the commits and adds the whole changes done in the feature to staging
    git merge --squash feature

    # commit the changes with appropriate message
    git commit -m 'merged feature with master: feature -- is added'

master -> m1    m2     merged(HEAD, master)

2. Non Fast-Forward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional commits in both master and feature branch after fetaure branch was created

Additional (merge) commit is created in master branch


.. image:: /_static/images/non-ff-recursive.png

There are four types of Non Fast-Forward merge

1. Recursive -> mainly used

.. code-block:: bash

    # explicitely mentioning --no-ff
    git merge --no-ff feature

    # below command applies recursive non fast forward
    # when there are commits in master after feature was created
    git merge feature

    git merge --squash feature


2. Octopus
   
3. Ours
   
4. Subtree


3. Rebase
~~~~~~~~~

Change the base (i.e. the parent commit) of commits in another branch

m3 becomes new base commit for commit created in feature branch.

rebase master to feature branch

merge rebase feature into master

.. warning:: 

    rebase does not move commits instead it creates new commits.

    Never rebase commits outside your repository.

    **Remember**: Rebasing re-writes code history!


.. image:: /_static/images/rebase.png

.. code-block:: bash

    # switch to feature
    git switch feature

    # run rebase in feature branch
    git rebase master


.. admonition:: When to Apply Rebase?

    **New commits in master branch while working in feature branch**

    Feature relies on additional commits in master branch

    Rebase master into feature branch

    ---

    Feature is finished – Implementation into master without merge commit

    Rebase master into feature + (fast-forward) merge feature into master


Handling Merge Conflicts
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge feature

    # when conflicts occurs, we need to resolves the conflicts and commit
    # other wise wwe can abort the merge

    git merge --abort

    # which shows the commits which are have merge conflicts
    git log --merge

Cherry Pick
-----------

Copy commit including the changes made only in this commit as HEAD to other
branch

.. code-block:: bash

    # commit hash code from another branch
    git cherry-pick <commit-hash>


.. list-table:: Merge vs Rebase vs Cherry-Pick
   :widths: 33 33 34
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Merge (non fast-forward) 
     - Rebase
     - Cherry-Pick
   * - Create merge commit
     - Change single commit‘s parent
     - Add specific commit to branch (HEAD)
   * - New commit 
     - New commit ID(s) 
     - Copies commit with new ID


Understanding Tagging
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # to add tag
    git tag <version_1.0> <commit_hash>

    # to list tags
    git tag

    # to show tags info
    git show 1.0

    # checkout to tag
    git checkout 1.0
