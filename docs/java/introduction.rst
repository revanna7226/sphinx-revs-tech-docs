Project Description:

    MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. 
    MLOps is a application that bridges the gap between data science and IT operations to streamline 
    the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle—from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring. 
    It enables continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous training of ML models, 
    ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and governance across machine learning workflows.

    As the Senior Developer leading a team of two—one frontend and one backend developer-
    I was responsible for gathering requirements from the client, seeking clarifications, 
    and distributing tasks to the team members. 

    I personally handled most of the backend tasks, focusing on machine learning workflows, 
    model development, and configuration management.

    In addition to these responsibilities, as a Java backend developer in an MLOps project, my tasks included designing 
    and developing scalable RESTful APIs for model serving, integrating machine learning models into backend services, 
    and managing data persistence using relational databases. I implemented automated ML pipelines using Spring Boot, 
    orchestrated workflows for model training and deployment, and ensured robust error handling and logging. 
    I also worked on securing backend services through authentication and authorization, optimized performance 
    for high-load scenarios, and collaborated closely with DevOps teams for containerization and CI/CD automation, s
    enabling smooth continuous delivery of ML models in production environments.

    Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features 
    that improve the performance of machine learning models.

        * - **Stage**
          - **Description**
          - **MLOps Considerations**
        * - **Data Ingestion**
          - Collect raw data from multiple sources (databases, APIs, streams, logs).
          - Use pipelines (e.g., Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines) for automated, repeatable ingestion.
        * - **Feature Extraction**
          - Derive features such as averages, ratios, counts, or domain-specific metrics.
          - Automate via feature pipelines; ensure deterministic transformations.
        * - **Feature Transformation**
          - Normalize, scale, encode, or bucketize features.
          - Track transformations using metadata; apply same steps in training & serving.
        * - **Feature Selection**
          - Choose most impactful features using statistical or ML-based methods.
          - Integrate explainability and validation metrics into CI/CD pipelines.
        * - **Feature Store Management**
          - Store reusable features for training and inference.
          - Use a centralized **Feature Store** (like Feast, Hopsworks, or Vertex AI Feature Store).
        * - **Feature Monitoring**
          - Detect feature drift and data quality issues in production.
          - Monitor data distribution and alert on anomalies.
