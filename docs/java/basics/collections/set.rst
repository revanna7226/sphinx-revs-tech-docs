Set Interface
==================

- A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
- built on Hashing data structure.
- Sets are unordered collections, meaning they do not maintain the order of insertion.
- Set does not allow null elements (except for HashSet which allows one null element).
- Elements in a Set cannot be accessed by an index since they do not preserve the order of insertion.
- Sets can be iterated using loops or iterators.
- Sets can be converted to arrays and vice versa.
- Sets can be synchronized for thread-safe operations using Collections.synchronizedSet().
- Sets can be created using the Set.of() method for immutable sets in Java 9 and later versions.
- Sets can be implemented using different classes like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet, each with its own characteristics regarding ordering and performance.
- Sets can be used in various applications like removing duplicates from a collection, membership testing, and implementing mathematical sets.
