Queue Interface
==================

- A Queue is a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
- built on Linear data structure.
- Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
- Queues can contain duplicate elements.
- Queue allows null elements.
- Elements in a Queue do not preserve the order of insertion and hence no index.
